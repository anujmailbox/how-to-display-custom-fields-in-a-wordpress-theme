# [Displaying Custom Fields in a WordPress Theme][published url]
## Instructor: [Rachel McCollin][instructor url]

Custom fields let you add extra information to your WordPress posts. They're easy to set up, but unless your theme supports them, they wonâ€™t be displayed on your site. 

In this course, you'll learn how to display your custom fields in single posts and in post archives. You'll also learn how to use conditional tags to check if a specific custom field has been populated for a post, so that you only display the field if it has data.


## Source Files Description

This repository has the complete WordPress theme created during the course, a subtheme of Twenty Sixteen that displays some custom fields.
